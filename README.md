**TIPS is a Chromium browser extension designed to enhance online communication by providing AI-powered interpretations of text and images.**

It draws inspiration from the research concepts presented in the TwIPS messaging platform ([arXiv:2407.17760](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17760)).
See the project [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nshcoPpixGUOw4tU8csQm7JQtdqcUCGqiwjO3W1fTMw/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

## Overview

In online discussions, forums, and social media, the true meaning, tone, and context behind content can often be unclear - especially to neurodivergent users. TIPS aims to bridge this gap by offering users quick AI insights directly within their browser. By selecting text, images, or links, users can invoke AI-powered interpretation to better understand nuance, tone, and implied meaning.

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Alpha - v0.6.1:** This extension is currently under active development, focusing on the core "Interpret" and "Context" features via the right-click menu. Expect bugs and ongoing changes.

## Features

### Interpret Text
Select any text on a webpage, right-click, and choose "Interpret" to get AI analysis of its meaning, tone, and nuance.

### Interpret Images
Right-click on any image and select "Interpret" to analyze the visual content.

### Enhanced Understanding with Context
Add relevant page elements to context before interpreting for more accurate results.

### Core Functionality Details

*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Users can click on the 'üí°' icon or select `Interpret` from the context menu to trigger analysis of the selected content.
    *   Doing so sends the target content and any user-added context to the background service worker.
    *   The background script calls the Anthropic Claude API with a specialized system prompt designed for contextual interpretation, confidence scoring, and tone analysis.
    *   The AI response is parsed and the result (interpretation, original content reference, context used) is displayed in the popup.
*   **Context Menu:**
    *   Right-clicking on selected text, images, links, or the page itself reveals context menu options: `Interpret`, `Add to Context` and `Clear Context`.
    *   Selecting "Add to Context" saves a reference to the right-clicked element to a temporary list associated with the current tab.
    *   This list of context items is included with subsequent "Interpret" requests for that tab, allowing users to guide the AI's understanding. Context is automatically cleared when the tab is closed or navigated away.
*   **Popup Display:**
    *   The popup shows the element that was interpreted, displaying the AI's interpretation text below the element.
*   **Welcome Page:**
    *   Upon first installation, the extension opens a welcome page explaining the features and basic usage.

### Future Features

See the [Road Map](ROADMAP.md) for details on planned features.

## Technology Stack

*   **Platform:** Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI (Popup):** Svelte
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **AI:** Anthropic Claude API via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
*   **Styling:** CSS (component styles in Svelte)

## Development Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

2.  **Clone & Navigate:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andrewelawrence/TIPS
    cd TIPS
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the TIPS directory
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/).
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    # Add your key to the file: `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE`
    # *(Note: `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` and should not be committed.)*
    ```
    *   **Configure Firebase Logging:**
        *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
        *   Add the following to your `.env.local` file:
            ```
            VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=YOUR_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
            VITE_ENABLE_LOGGING=true
            ```

5.  **Build the Extension:**
    ```bash
    # Still TIPS
    npm run build
    ```
    *   This compiles the code and outputs the necessary files to the `dist/` directory at the project root.

6.  **Load in Chrome:**
    *   Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable "Developer mode".
    *   Click "Load unpacked".
    *   Select the `dist/` directory (the one created by the build process).

7.  **Usage:**
    *   The extension should now be active. Right-click elements or select text and click the üí° icon to use TIPS.

## Architecture
```
[ Content Script (content.ts) ]        <-- User interacts with page (selection, right-click)
         | (Detects selection -> shows icon)
         | (Manages icon click -> sends INTERPRET_TEXT to background)
         | (Receives confirmation -> shows tooltip)
         |
         |-----> [ Right-Click Event ] ---> [ Background Script (background.ts) ] <-- User adds context / interprets
                     | (Context Menu Click: Interpret / Add to Context)
                     | (Info about clicked element: selectionText, srcUrl, linkUrl, pageUrl)
                     v
[ Background Service Worker (background.ts) ]
         | (Handles context menu clicks)
         | (Manages context list per tab in chrome.storage/memory)
         | (Receives INTERPRET_TEXT message OR context menu interpret click)
         | (Retrieves API key, context list)
         | (Calls Anthropic API with target + context) --> [ Anthropic API ]
         | (Parses response, stores interpretation in chrome.storage.local)
         | (Sends confirmation to content script if applicable)
         | (Handles chrome.runtime.onInstalled for welcome page)
         v
[ Popup (Popup.svelte / main.ts) ]   <-- User Clicks Toolbar Icon
         | (Loads last interpretation data from chrome.storage.local on open)
         | (Displays interpreted element, interpretation, tone, confidence)
```
